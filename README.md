This learning project aimed to create Self Evaluating Rules as described in David West's whitepaper.
Here's the abstract (emphasis is mine):

> Every organization establishes a myriad of rules that define, associate, constrain and formulate. 
> Every information system must accomodate the support and maintenance of those rules. This paper 
> proposes a means to **treat rules as independent objects capable of self resolution**. Benefits
> from this approach include the ability to provide other objects with the rules they require to
> complete their assigned tasks, to modify the behaviour of objects at run time by replacing the 
> rules they use, and to modify the rules (and hence the nature of the object returned as a result
> of evaluation) at run time as well.

So, the goal of this project is to provide the framework to create, modify and evaluate rules, 
treated as objects.

Moreover, I try to use some new (at least for me) tools, first of all - microtasking with the help 
of [Puzzle-Driven Development](https://www.yegor256.com/2010/03/04/pdd.html) and 
[0pdd Github bot](https://www.0pdd.com/).
